I'm an Applied Math PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder, working under the mentorship of [Dr. Vanja Dukic](http://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/vdukic/).  My research interests include Bayesian Statistics, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, and Ecology. I also have an amateur interest in thee history and philosophy of statistics.

In my spare time I enjoy cooking, biking around Boulder, and watching dogs from my kitchen window, lamenting the clause in my lease forbidding pets.
