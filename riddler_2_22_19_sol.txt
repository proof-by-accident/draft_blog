_Notation_
*I will refer to the first and second claims by person X as "Claim X1" and "Claim X2" respectively
*Denote individual X having age N by X=N
*Denote individual X being younger/older than N by X <= N or X >= N respectively
*Denote truth/lie status of individual X as X~Truer/Liar

_Claims_
The setup of the riddle is as follows:
Claim A1: B > 20
Claim A2: D > 16

Claim B1: C > 18
Claim B2: E < 20

Claim C1: D < 22
Claim C2: A = 19

Claim D1: E != 17
Claim D2: B = 20

Claim E1: A > 21
Claim E2: C < 18


_Knowns_
From contradictions in the claims we can immediately conclude the following:
Fact 1: Liar in {A,D}
Fact 2: Liar in {B,E}
Fact 3: Liar in {C,E}

_Theorem_
D ~ Truer

_Proof_
We show this using proof by contradiction. I will make an assumption and show that it leads to contradictory conclusions,\
which implies that the assumption is false.
ASSUME (to contradict) that D ~ Liar:
=> E = 17 (Claim D1)
=> B ~ Truer (Claim B2)
=> E ~ Liar (Fact 2)
=> L <= 17 (Definition and E=17)
=> B <= 17 (Definition and L<=17)
=> A ~ Liar (Claim A1 and B <= 17)
=> D <= 16 (Claim A2 and A ~ Liar) *Statement to be Contradicted

=> C >= 19 (Claim B1)
=> C ~ Liar (by L<=17)
=> D >= 22 (Claim C1)
CONTRADICTION

CONCLUDE D ~ Truer

_Knowns_
Since D ~ Truer we gain the following facts:
Fact 4: B = 20 (Claim D2)
Fact 5: A ~ Liar (Fact 1)
Fact 6: D <= 16 (Claim A2)

_Theorem_
C ~ Truer

_Proof_
We will use another proof by contradiction
ASSUME (to Contradict) C ~ Liar
=> D >= 22 (Claim C1)
CONTRADICTION (Fact 6)

CONCLUDE C ~ Truer

_Knowns_
Since C ~ Truer we gain the following facts:
Fact 8: E ~ Liar (Fact 3)
Fact 9: C >= 18 (Claim E2)
Fact 10: L >= 18 (Definition)
Fact 11: A = 19 (Claim C2)
Fact 12: L <= 19 (Definition and Fact 10)
Fact 13: L = 19 (Facts 9-12)
Fact 14: B ~ Liar (Fact 4)
Fact 15: E >= 20 (Fact 14 and Claim B2)

_Solution_
We have established that L = 19, and that Truers = {D,C} and Liars = {A,B,E}. We have that A=19, B=20, C=18, D<=16, E>=20

_Comments_
My choice to test the assertion that D ~ Truer was based on a inuition that D's statements were the most "informative". No matter
if D was a Truer or Liar, they gave use the exact age of another individual, which wasn't obviously true for any other individual.
In the process of proving that D ~ Truer I noticed that we had also determined that C ~ Truer as a corrolary (since we still had
that D <= 16 because A ~ Liar if D ~ Truer). These two results locked up the whole thing.
